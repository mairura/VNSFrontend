# How it works
This is a replica of unstoppable domains in that it allows one to set up theie domain names with a prefixed extention which would point out to their
websites.
The idea of unstoppable domains imply in the essence that once one has set up a doamin on velas blockchain, it is secure forever.
This concept build to reduce the cost of paying for domains, the attempts of bringing it down upon unpayment and keeping them secure.
